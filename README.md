# Unsupervised_Learning
Classifying the vehicle from its Silhouette

# Data Description
The data contains features extracted from the silhouette of vehicles in different angles. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles has been chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

Domain:Object recognition

# Context
The purpose is to classify a given silhouette as one of three types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.

# Attribute Information

● All the features are geometric features extracted from the silhouette.

● All are numeric in nature.

# Outcomes

● Exploratory Data Analysis

● Reducing number dimensions in the dataset with minimal information loss

● Training a model using Principle Components

# Objective

Applying dimensionality reduction technique – PCA and training a model using principle components instead of training the model using just the raw data.

# Steps and tasks
1. Data pre-processing – Performing all the necessary preprocessing on the data ready to be fed to an Unsupervised algorithm.
2. Understanding the attributes - Finding relationship between different attributes (Independent variables) and choosing carefully which all attributes have to be a part of the analysis and why?
3. Splitting the data into train and test.
4. Training a Support vector machine using the train set and get the accuracy on the test set.
5. Performing K-fold cross validation and get the cross validation score of the model. 
6. Using PCA from Scikit learn, extract Principal Components that capture about 95% of the variance in the data. 
7. Repeating steps 3,4 and 5 but this time, using Principal Components instead of the original data. 
8. Comparing the accuracy scores and cross validation scores of Support vector machines – one trained using raw data and the other using Principal Components, and mentioning our findings.
